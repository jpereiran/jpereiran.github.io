You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

### Solution

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight pyhon %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
{% endhighlight %}
